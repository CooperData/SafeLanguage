1080°'s development took place from April or May 1997 to March 1998. The game was released on 28 February 1998 in Japan and on 1 April 1998 in North America. Nintendo delayed the game's European release because they hoped to boost sales with a winter release; 1080° was eventually released on 30 November 1998, in Europe and the PAL region.
