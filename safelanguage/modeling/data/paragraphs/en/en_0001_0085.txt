This is in fact true of the binary expansions of many rational numbers, where the values of the numbers are equal but the corresponding binary tree paths are different. For example, 0.10111...2 = 0.11000...2, which are both equal to  3⁄4, but the first representation corresponds to the binary tree path LRLRLLL... while the second corresponds to the different path LRLLRRR....
