Second, a comparable theorem applies in each radix or base. For example, in base 2 (the binary numeral system) 0.111... equals 1, and in base 3 (the ternary numeral system) 0.222... equals 1. In general, any terminating base b expression has a counterpart with repeated trailing digits equal to b âˆ’ 1. Textbooks of real analysis are likely to skip the example of 0.999... and present one or both of these generalizations from the start.
