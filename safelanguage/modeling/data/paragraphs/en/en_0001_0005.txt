Therefore, if 1 were not the smallest number greater than 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc, then there would be a point on the number line that lies between 1 and all these points. This point would be at a distance from 1 that is less than 1/10n for every integer n. In the standard number systems (the rational numbers and the real numbers), there is no number that is less than 1/10n for all n. This is (one version of) the Archimedean property, which can be proven to hold in the system of rational numbers. Therefore, 1 is the smallest number that is greater than all 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc, and so
