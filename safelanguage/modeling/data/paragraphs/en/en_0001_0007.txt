The previous explanation is not a proof, as one cannot define properly the relationship between a number and its representation as a point on the number line. For the accuracy of the proof, the number 0.999...9, with n nines after the decimal point, is denoted 0.(9)n. Thus 0.(9)1 = 0.9, 0.(9)2 = 0.99, 0.(9)3 = 0.999, and so on. As 1/10n = 0.0...01, with n digits after the decimal point, the addition rule for decimal numbers implies
