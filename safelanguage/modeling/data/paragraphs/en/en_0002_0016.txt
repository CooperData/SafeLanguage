1080째 Snowboarding sold 1,230,000 units in the United States, and over 23,000 in Japan. It did not, however, match the success of the developers' first game, Wave Race 64 which sold 1,950,000 units in the United States and 154,000 in Japan. 1080째 Avalanche, a sequel to 1080째 Snowboarding, was released for the GameCube in 2003; the sequel received a harsher critical reception, due to "frame rate issues and limited gameplay". 1080째 Snowboarding was re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2008.
