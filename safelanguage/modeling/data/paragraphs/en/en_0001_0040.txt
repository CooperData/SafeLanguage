If (xn) and (yn) are two Cauchy sequences, then they are defined to be equal as real numbers if the sequence (xn âˆ’ yn) has the limit 0. Truncations of the decimal number b0.b1b2b3... generate a sequence of rationals which is Cauchy; this is taken to define the real value of the number. Thus in this formalism the task is to show that the sequence of rational numbers
