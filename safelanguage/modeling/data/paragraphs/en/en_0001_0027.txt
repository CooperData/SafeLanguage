The first two equalities can be interpreted as symbol shorthand definitions. The remaining equalities can be proven. The last step, that  1⁄10n → 0 as n → ∞, is often justified by the Archimedean property of the real numbers. This limit-based attitude towards 0.999... is often put in more evocative but less precise terms. For example, the 1846 textbook The University Arithmetic explains, ".999 +, continued to infinity = 1, because every annexation of a 9 brings the value closer to 1"; the 1895 Arithmetic for Schools says, "...when a large number of 9s is taken, the difference between 1 and .99999... becomes inconceivably small". Such heuristics are often interpreted by students as implying that 0.999... itself is less than 1.
