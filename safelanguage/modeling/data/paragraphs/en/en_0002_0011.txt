1080° Snowboarding received "generally favorable" reviews, according to review aggregator website Metacritic. It won the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' 1999 Console Sports Game of the Year award, and was called "one of the best values in both sports and racing gaming" by Josh Smith GameSpot. 1080° Snowboarding has been perceived to be a leader among snowboarding titles at the time, with IGN's Levi Buchanan stating: "every single snowboarding game that followed 1080 borrows from Nintendo's formula". Edge hailed it as the "most convincing video game emulation of the snowboarding experience so far" with an "atmosphere of sobriety" unlike any other Nintendo game at the time.
