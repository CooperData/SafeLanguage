In mathematics, 0.999... (also written 0.9, among other ways), denotes the repeating decimal consisting of infinitely many 9 after the decimal point (and one 0 before it). This repeating decimal represents the smallest number no less than all decimal numbers 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc. This number can be shown to equal 1. In other words, "0.999..." and "1" represent the same number. There are many ways of showing this equality, from intuitive arguments to mathematically rigorous proofs. The technique used depends on target audience, background assumptions, historical context, and preferred development of the real numbers, the system within which 0.999... is commonly defined. (In other systems, 0.999... can have the same meaning, a different definition, or be undefined.)
